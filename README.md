The Python Flask-based cognitive training platform aims to provide a comprehensive solution for addressing the diverse cognitive needs of children with developmental disabilities. 
Leveraging Flask, a lightweight and efficient web framework, the application offers a user-friendly interface accessible to both children and caregivers. Through interactive exercises, 
gamified learning paths, and real-time progress tracking, the platform empowers children with tailored cognitive training experiences. By setting a new standard for technology integration in cognitive training, 
this platform has the potential to revolutionize special education and pave the way for future innovations.
